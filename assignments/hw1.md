### Assignments

**Assignment 1: Self-Reflection**

This assignment asks you to think about your own life and career plans, looking at your ethics and your values in a deeper way. You will not need any citations to complete this assignment, as we hope this acts more of an exploratory space for you personally to connect the course materials to your life. Thus we anticipate you writing these reflections more akin to a journal entry than an academic essay.

The assignment involves doing 3 reflections:

1. Career  
   1. How would you describe your career goals? Are they in line or in conflict with your view of a happy life?  
   2. How much agency do you believe you have in determining the trajectory of your career? Do you believe it’ll be hard or easy to find a job that taps into your interests and aligns with your values?  
   3. How does money factor into your career plans? What amount of money do you hope to make and what do you hope it provides you?  
2. Values  
   1. What are the 2 most important values that orient your moral compass? Define those values in your own words.  
   2. Using the two values from (a), provide examples of how they show up in technology and engineering domains through normative considerations made by engineers, companies, and users of technology.  
3. Growth  
   1. Where do you want to grow in the next few years of life? What skills and capabilities do you feel weak on that you’d like to improve to live a happier and more fulfilling life? How does your use of technology help or hinder these growth goals?  
      1. If you need help considering your own skills and growth points, consider taking the Character Strengths Survey: [https://www.viacharacter.org/account/register](https://www.viacharacter.org/account/register) 

- Deliverable: Submit three reflections on the 3 prompts above, each can be 1-3 pages in length and have no formal citation or writing requirements besides using the prompts to guide your thinking and writing.


**Assignment 2: Self-Directed Topic Exploration**  
This assignment will launch you onto a semester-long inquiry to deepen your understanding and your position on a key issue in technology you care about. You will have to select a topic that you find to be particularly concerning, urgent, or fascinating where you hope to learn more through the semester. Thus, in this assignment, you will do some initial exploration to establish a set of questions, provide current thinking, and do some initial analysis while in the final homework for this semester, you will have to return to provide a much deeper viewpoint and provide a final position on the questions you outline here.

To complete this assignment, you’ll need to:

1. Write a topic statement in the form of a question  
   1. Provide basic background information on the topic, why you think it's important, and what makes it relevant to technologists/engineers and society?   
      1. Examples of topics: “Is there still any meaningful privacy in today’s world?”; “How should we handle online misinformation?”; “How do we reconcile the environmental and energy costs of rapid adoption of computation-heavy AI models?”)  
      2. It is important that you pick something you actually care about and really hope to gain more insight on.  
   2. Distill the topic into a set of 3-5 sub-questions you think need to be answered to create an informed perspective on the issue. Provide your current thinking on these questions in short form (1 paragraph is fine)  
      1. Discuss how this question and your current position connects back to your values you articulated in Assignment 1\.  
   3. Provide a brief analysis through the “3 ethical lenses for analyzing technology” that we’ll discuss in class. You’ll only need a paragraph or two to apply each of these frames.  
      1. Computing Ethics  
         1. How does scale and/or human replacement (full automation) create new risks or heighten certain ethical and social challenges?  
      2. Technology Ethics  
         1. How do specific patterns of adoption and use of this technology by people and organizations create potential risks or ethical challenges?  
      3. Engineering Ethics  
         1. What technical and engineering choices are pertinent to the escalation or mitigation of the risks and ethical challenges being considered?  
- Deliverable: Submit the resulting write-up as a short essay (2-5 pages) using 12pt font and 1.15 line spacing. Please include at least 3 citations; drawing from readings and class content or identifying equally strong sources on your own.

**Assignment 3: Constructive Dialogue**  
This assignment asks you to engage in a series of dialogues to help gain experience and confidence in addressing controversial, ethical challenges you’ll face in your life and in the workplace. Specifically, we’ll be asking you to engage directly with how optimistic or cynical you feel about these topics. There will be 4 topics to choose from to complete this assignment: 2 provided by the instructors and 2 determined in recitation from student input. You’ll need to lightly engage with all 4, and deeply engage with 1,

The two topics from the instructors are:

1. *Will AI make humans dumber?*  
   1. We must wrestle with whether or not we are on an arc of technologies such as search engines and content algorithms, and now AI, that make information more accessible and make us more productive and capable, while potentially diminishing our independent thinking skills and threatening our ability to harness these tools to realize our higher-level goals and the greater good.   
2. *Is technology a tool of top-down control or for personal freedom?*  
   1. Some see technology as a way to force us to be more exposed, more tracked, more distracted, and fed more controlled information than ever before; whereas others see technology as a vehicle for building movements, accessing the world’s information, and shaping the world around us. 

To complete this assignment, you’ll need to:

1. Draft a simple argument map that identifies the “optimistic” and “cynical” positions, and state your position for all 4 topics (ie., identify in 1-2 sentences two sides, state 2 arguments that support each side, and identify where you stand – pick a side and qualify if you strongly or weakly support that position).  
   1. This will all be done during class and recitation time and you’ll submit these on Canvas. Your submission points will go toward your total point tally for this homework.  
2. Pick a topic to go deep on and engage in the following dialogues about it:  
   1. Pick someone, ideally from outside of the class, and use the Socratic Dialogue Method to get to know their viewpoint on one of the four topics for this assignment. Ask them to discuss their thinking on the question you’ve chosen and ask them questions that support you in fully understanding how they think.  
   2. Professor Skirpan will provide a link to an AI Agent on Canvas that you’ll engage in a dialogue with to assess your own viewpoint, gaining a deeper understanding of the rationale, counter-rationale and facts that shape your view  
   3. You’ll be assigned a student from our class who holds a different perspective from you and will have to meet up to have a conversation with this individual. You will similarly take turns discussing your viewpoints, using active listening skills and socratic dialogue, to learn how the other thinks and avoid actually debating the issue.

- Deliverable: Create an argument map and write a synthesis  
1. Create an argument map that outlines both the optimistic and cynical view thoroughly, leveraging what you learned from others. Provide arguments, cite reasons and facts that support those arguments as well as the key counter-arguments.  
2. Draft a short synthesis of your final perspective on the issue and specifically reference what you learned from the dialogues and others viewpoints and how those reinforced or changed your initial perspective.
