### Grading

* Homeworks (40%)  
  * 4 Assignments with 2-3 deliverables each  
* Class Engagement (30%)  
  * 10% Class Attendance  
  * 10% Recitation Participation  
  * 10% Discussion  
* Written/Verbal Exam (15%)  
* Final Group Presentations (15%)

### Course Requirements

**Class Engagement** (30% of grade): Class engagement points are broken up into 3 components outlined below:

1. *Attendance* (10%) \- Class attendance will be taken at each lecture. Each lecture and recitation is worth a point. **Students are granted 4 grace days meaning you can miss up to 4 days with no penalty** (ie., we drop 4 points of the total before calculating your grade at the end of semester). If you are experiencing extended illness or some other type of emergency situation, please reach out to Profs. Skirpan and CC your academic advisor to discuss an attendance accommodation.   
   1. **NOTE: Being more than 30 mins late, counts as an absence**  
2. *Discussion participation* (10%) – throughout class time, there will be prompted discussion and chances for discourse with your instructors and fellow students. The entire class will also be asked to participate in small group discussions or solo exercises, and to share perspectives from their small groups or private work with the rest of the class. TAs will be tracking who engaged in public discussion and share-outs through contributing ideas and arguments, sharing insights from activities, and asking **content relevant** questions (ie., “when is the assignment due?” does not count). Our benchmark is to reach 8 significant contributions to class discussion throughout the semester for 100% in this area.  
   1. Each week we will post updates to the discussion participation grades. I**f you believe the grades contain an error, you will have 3 business days (ie., non-holiday weekdays) from when grades are released to notify your lead TA and have us reconsider.** We cannot allow disputes to be reported after the 3 day window as it is nearly impossible to be able to remember enough about class interactions to support a dispute later than this.  
3. *Recitations (10%)*  
   1. There will be 11 recitations where attendance and participation will be tracked. We will drop 3 at the end of the semester meaning you must participate in at least 8 recitations through the semester. Some recitations may have a submission component following the activity / discussion assigned; though submissions should be able to be completed during recitation time or in a few mins following. If you are more than 10 mins late to a recitation, you will not be able to receive credit for participation. TAs also have discretionary privilege to not give attendance if you do not engage in recitation by being distracted or disrespectful.

**Homeworks** (40% of grade): Throughout the course, there will be 4 homework assignments, equally weighted. The assignments directly relate to the key skills and content the course seeks to cover, please see each assignment write-up on Canvas for specifics.

Each assignment has 2-3 submissions that will have gradual due dates, leading up to a completion date. See our **late policy** (below) for more details. The homework content will be broken up roughly as follows:

1. Homework 1  
   1. Self-reflection journal  
   2. Self-directed semester topic exploration  
   3. Constructive Dialogue Assignment  
2. Homework 2   
   1. Big Data Problem Analysis  
   2. Risk and Communication Framing Exercise  
   3. Policy Formation for Big Data / AI Scenario  
3. Homework 3   
   1. Scenario Translation  
   2. Forecast \- technology and context of use  
   3. Technology Business Analysis  
4. Homework 4   
   1. Final Presentation Report  
   2. Final Paper for Self-Directed Topic

**Verbal or Written Exam** (15% of grade): Roughly halfway through the course we will have a short exam. You will have the option to do a verbal or written assessment:

- Verbal: a 25 minute discussion with a TA or Instructor where class ideas will be asked and discussed, student will engage in a light debate about a topic. Conversation will be somewhat open but it is expected students will be able to converse about class readings and materials to some degree. If something is asked that a student is unfamiliar with, it will be fine to say you’re unsure and discussion will move on with little or no penalty. We will be looking for sufficient coverage that indicates some level of expertise is developing.  
- Written: a 45 min (maximum time) written exam will be typed/written during class and submitted on Canvas. The exam will look for fluency with concepts, analytic process, and some literacy with course readings/materials.

**Final Presentation** (10% of final grade)**:** The final presentation will involve you working with a group (2-4 people) to develop a short verbal presentation and corresponding visual aid to explain a topic of interest relevant to the course (e.g., AI and Medical Malpractice). We will have a class showcase time where students will have an opportunity to set up their visuals and present to our TAs and members of the public who the instructional team will invite. During the presentation time, “graders” will go around and stop at each team’s station to get a short presentation and overview and ask questions. Groups will be graded based on clarity of presentation, accessibility to the general public, and team communication dynamics. There will be a short report that is submitted along with the presentation that summarizes your research, key cases and arguments, and explains what the public should know and do about the issue.

* The class final presentations will be held on the last Thursday of classes from 2-4PM in TCS Hall Lobby  
  * If you cannot stay past 3:20 (usual class time) please inform Prof Skirpan or a TA in advance. We ask if at all possible that you plan to stay until 4PM to get sufficient coverage speaking with the graders/attendees.

### 

### Course Plans and Policies

Please be aware that this course uses Canvas and you should be regularly checking Canvas for the most up to date information on the class.

**Late Policy**

Assignments turned in late will generally receive a 5% penalty in the first 48 hours, and no longer be accepted after 48 hours, unless you’ve received explicit permission from an instructor. 

Homework assignments will have intermediate deadlines and a final deadline for each homework. Students are granted two (2) late passes for the entire semester.  These late passes allow the student to turn in the assignment due at the intermediate deadline on the final homework deadline with no penalty.  Late passes cannot be used to extend beyond the final homework deadline for each assignment and cannot be used to delay your midterm exam or final presentation. 

**Lecture Time** 

Class is held in person, attendance is taken each day, and our lecture time does involve critical points of student engagement. *This is a **discussion heavy class** so expect to be called on and prepared to talk during class*. 

Each lecture will involve moderated discussion with the support of our TAs and occasionally course guests. Every single lecture will contain points of open dialogue and Q\&A with students, most classes will have a component of active learning such as a workshop, debate, or socratic discussion. We will be tracking student participation in the class dialogue which will contribute to your grade.

There will be lecture slides that distill core content, definitions, references, and examples. Many classes will have a central question and/or case that frames discussion. We will use slides and content to illuminate and deepen discussion, and in most cases we will return to dialogue or other forms of active learning to further digest content.

The use of laptops during discussion is strongly discouraged as there is ample evidence this harms learning \[[1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00986283211017443?casa_token=t23Zw9u99HsAAAAA%3ASZ2qJqNYeFxOSPWVxBdJgWouZc_6flFyxzrLuvaQX5JHXt7XLRGx2qbkqm8G0zuoMmkcf81xnfUO), [2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0360131520301007?via%3Dihub)\]. However, it is strictly prohibited to be on your laptop during active learning and discussion. Doing so will cause you to lose your attendance points, and continued abuse of this class norm could cause you to also lose your participation grade. See the “Laptop Policy” below for more details

**Recitation Sessions**

Recitations are a very important part of the course. Recitations will be led by TAs and will involve active learning exercises that deepens work done in lecture and puts you into direct discussion with your peers.

Nearly all recitations will be directly connected to homework submissions, giving you an opportunity to work on the assignment and participate in activities that advance the requisite work. Pay close attention to what’s planned for recitations as some recitations will be very important, and missing the recitation will put you at a serious disadvantage for fully completing your assignment. Being an engaged participant in recitation will reduce your overall workload and increase your likelihood of a good grade. Recitations are built to support your homework progress and are run by the TAs grading homeworks so view these experiences as an opportunity to get ahead on work and get insights on what’s expected for grading.

Due to recitations being critically integrated into the homework assignments, we will take attendance. Please see the Class Engagement section of the syllabus above for info on attendance requirements in recitation. 

**Course Objectives**

This course is expected to introduce students to ethical thinking and writing as it relates to technology and engineering. We will take a very applied approach to teaching ethics where our goals will be more about supporting each student in adopting practical and reproducible mental habits that  allow you to go about your specialized work with an ethical lens or mindset. We will also reinforce writing and communication skills such that each student is better prepared to both speak and write about ethical concepts and frameworks in their discussion of technology and engineering. The learning outcomes you can expect are:

1. Increased communication skills in writing and speaking about ethics in the technology and engineering context  
2. An improved awareness of current events related to technology ethics issues and science and technology policy  
3. An improved awareness of differing perspectives around different ethical dilemmas and issues  
4. Translational skills for converting ethical concepts into engineering examples, choices, and practices, and vice versa.  
5. Ability to reason through and creatively interpret engineering problems and scenarios using ethical frameworks and concepts  
6. Develop your own personal ethical standards around how you approach computing issues within your future career. 

**Laptop Policy**

Laptops are strongly discouraged during class as this is not a computing class and is a class about thinking, analyzing, listening, and communicating. Our preference is students do not use laptops and instead bring a writing tool such as notebooks and/or smart pencils & tablets for notetaking. 

The laptop policy is broken up as follows:

1. Lecture Portion: During lecture, we will create a “smoking section,” which will be the last row and back-of-the-room chairs. The smoking section is the only place laptops are allowed open during lecture. Students who are not using laptops should not be able to see screens in front of them or in their periphery as research has shown this inherently increases distraction and diminishes learning outcomes.  
2. Discussion and Active Learning: Once class content is moved toward active learning and/or class discussion, laptops MUST be closed. Occasionally, we may have an active learning session that allows the use of laptops, and we will be explicit about this; otherwise, we ask that you listen to your peers, engage in discussion, and focus on the class activity. Unauthorized use of laptops during discussion and/or active learning will lead to losing your attendance point for the day. Continued abuse of this policy may cost you participation points.  
3. Recitation: Laptops should not be used during recitation unless specific instruction is given that laptops can be used within the confines of the session for purposes of research, writing drafts, etc. TAs will have the discretion to not give an attendance point for recitation if students choose to use a laptop in a distracting or disengaging manner.

### On Tolerance and Respect

In this course students will be expected to engage in discussion about ethics, which is a notoriously thorny and personal matter. Taking this course implies you are interested in improving your comprehension and awareness of ethical issues in computing. Part of developing a viewpoint and set of ethics is understanding the landscape of thought. One of the objectives of this course is to gain viewpoint diversity \- meaning you understand the different mindset and reasons for many different ways of thinking about an issue. In order to tread this together and learn from one another, we must listen to each other and fundamentally give one another respect and the benefit of the doubt. 

**Go into conversations with curiosity and humility. Assume you don’t know everything about a topic and be committed to really understanding how the other person thinks.**

It is anticipated that cultural viewpoints are going to be bound into how we each interpret this material and so we expect that people will practice the art of careful listening. Students who feel certain discussions may be challenging for them to hold in a group setting are welcome to speak with the TAs in office hours as a replacement to group discussion, if you find yourself struggling to state your true viewpoints in the group setting. 

We remind you that we are creating **brave spaces not safe spaces,** that is we expect you will hear things that challenge you and may even trigger emotions. We will intervene and protect the space to prevent personal attacks, aggressive behavior, or threatening language. However, differences of opinion are fundamental and should be expected. Learning to operate in atmospheres of difference is important to being professionals and leaders.

We include the university’s DEI Statement which we align with in this course:

***We must treat every individual with respect.** We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.*

*Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.*

*Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:*

* ***Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion:** csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150*  
* [***Report-It***](http://www.reportit.net/) ***online anonymous reporting platform:** [reportit.net](http://www.reportit.net/) username**:** tartans password**:** plaid*

*All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.*

### Academic Integrity

Any work that you submit should be your own work (i.e., not borrowed/copied from any other source, including our assigned readings and your classmates). When using other people’s ideas to substantiate your own, please properly cite the original source. We will review proper citation procedures in class, and you should ask for clarification whenever needed. While you will be interacting with other students’ perspectives through the course, when writing your weekly assignments, midterm, and final paper, you should be expressing your own ideas and not theirs.

Any act of cheating or plagiarism will be treated in accordance with Carnegie Mellon’s Policy on Academic Integrity, which can be found here: [http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html](http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html). Depending upon the individual violation, students could face penalties ranging from failing the assignment to failing the class.

Note on the use of generative AI technologies: with attribution, you may use AI technologies like Grammarly to touch up your own original content, but the thought work must be your own. Use of generative AI technologies to auto-generate text that you submit as your own is strictly prohibited and can be considered an act of cheating or plagiarism as discussed above. If we suspect that submitted content has the look and feel of an AI technology (which has many markers in its logic and flow) then you may be randomly called on to explain your argument and work. If you are unable to, this will be cause for further review and potential disciplinary action.

If you are going to use ChatGPT or Claude or another genAI tool to help with papers, we recommend keeping all chat transcripts as we may ask to see them if we feel the paper does not represent you and your tone. If you are called in to verbally discuss your writing, having a copy of any genAI conversations will be helpful to understanding if/how you used AI.

### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

### Take care of yourself

Take care of yourself.  Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at [http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/](http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/).  Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.

We will intervene and protect the space to prevent personal attacks, aggressive behavior, or threatening language. However, differences of opinion are fundamental and should be expected. Learning to operate in atmospheres of difference is important to being professionals and leaders.

We include the university’s DEI Statement which we align with in this course:

We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community that increasingly embraces these core values.
Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.

Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the following resources:
Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: csdi@andrew.cmu.edu, (412) 268-2150
Report-It online anonymous reporting platform: reportit.net username: tartans password: plaid
All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and just.

## Academic Integrity

Any work that you submit should be your own work (i.e., not borrowed/copied from any other source, including our assigned readings and your classmates). When using other people’s ideas to substantiate your own, please properly cite the original source. We will review proper citation procedures in class, and you should ask for clarification whenever needed. While you will be interacting with other students’ perspectives through the course, when writing your weekly assignments, midterm, and final paper, you should be expressing your own ideas and not theirs.

Any act of cheating or plagiarism will be treated in accordance with Carnegie Mellon’s Policy on Academic Integrity, which can be found here: http://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html. Depending upon the individual violation, students could face penalties ranging from failing the assignment to failing the class.

Note on the use of generative AI technologies: with attribution, you may use AI technologies like Grammarly to touch up your own original content, but the thought work must be your own. Use of generative AI technologies to auto-generate text that you submit as your own is strictly prohibited and can be considered an act of cheating or plagiarism as discussed above. If we suspect that submitted content has the look and feel of an AI technology (which has many markers in its logic and flow) then you may be randomly called on to explain your argument and work. If you are unable to, this will be cause for further review and potential disciplinary action.
If you are going to use ChatGPT or Claude or another genAI tool to help with papers, we recommend keeping all chat transcripts as we may ask to see them if we feel the paper does not represent you and your tone. If you are called in to verbally discuss your writing, having a copy of any genAI conversations will be helpful to understanding if/how you used AI.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at access@andrew.cmu.edu.

## Take care of yourself

Take care of yourself.  Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/.  Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. -->
